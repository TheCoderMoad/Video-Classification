In this code, you need to specify the path to the directory containing the videos (video_dir),
 the output directory where the extracted frames will be saved (output_dir), 

and the interval at which you want to extract frames (interval).
 The code will iterate through the video files in the directory and extract frames at the specified interval, 
saving them as individual image files.

Make sure to install OpenCV (pip install opencv-python) before running the code.
 Adjust the file format condition (e.g., .mp4) if your videos have a different format
