code in Python for the second step, which involves object detection using a pre-trained model:

 Make sure to download the appropriate pre-trained model weights and configuration file for object detection.
You can find popular models like YOLO and Faster R-CNN that have been pre-trained on large datasets like COCO
Adjust the paths and filenames in the code accordingly.
In this code, you need to provide the path to :
-the input frame (frame_path) "that you want to detect"
-the weights file of the pre-trained model (model_weights) download from : https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
-the configuration file of the model (model_config) download from : https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov2.cfg
-the file containing the class names (classes_file) download from :https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names

The perform_object_detection function takes a frame and a pre-trained model as input.
It performs object detection on the frame using the model and returns the class IDs, confidences,
and bounding box coordinates of the detected objects.
